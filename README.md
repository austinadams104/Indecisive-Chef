# Indecisive-Chef
Final Project for Mobile Development class at Utah State University. 
The goal of this app is to help you keep track of the food you have in your house and help you pick what to eat for meals. 
The app will keep a list of recipes and what ingredients it takes to make them and compare it with the list of ingredients you already have. 
Finally there will be a random meal picker if you still can't decide what to make from the options available to you based on cooking time.
